on vellum, ol 278 leaves, written lor tho most part in the
Xlll²¹ century, and containing various works relating to
English history. The genealogy ol the kings ol Franco is no

longer to be lound there. On the author's name it adords
us but the following vague information‚ written by a different
lrand : “Explicit Historia Britonum versificata, a⁸magistro
AlexandroNequamcompilata,utcredo,etscriptaaddominum ’
bodincum, episcopum venetensem ¹. '’ Now it ought to be
Nequam instead ol Nopccc. But is really Alexander Necham
the author ol that worh‘l The compilor himsell ol tho
colophon doubts it, and nobody ascribes such a composition
lo the celebrated Neckham, author ol so many other writings
both in prose and in verso. The dates would not agree:
Nechham died, at the latest, in 1227 ⁸, and Cadioc was only
promoted to the episcopal seo ol tannes in 1236 ⁴.

Another manuscript copy ol the same poem is preserved
in the Cottonian Library, under the press mark ol Julius
