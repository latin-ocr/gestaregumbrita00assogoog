INTRODUOTION.

ΙΝ the following peges an attempt is made to relate
the history of the Lords of Glamorgan from its Con-
quest and settlement by Robert Fitz Hamon down to
the extinction, in the male line, of the House of Clare,
his descendants and successors. The history of the
LordS, for that period, is in lact the history of the

· Lordship, inasmueh as the system of feudal tenures

prevailed there in all its strietness and the relation
etween the Chief Lord, his tenants, and their tenants,
being of a military character, iu the presence of a brave
and implacable foe, was one of unusual closeness. The
Lordship itself was a fief of the Orown, and every manor
within it was held, mediately or immediately, of the
Ohief Lord, as of his Oastle of Cardiff.

The Lord held per integrant baroniam, but the lirni-
tations attending the tenure, undefined by grant or
charter, were not only widely different from those of
an ordinary barony or honour, but appear to have been
different also from those of the other Maroher Lordships
Glamorgan was a oounty, and its ambulatory parlia-
mentis styled a contitutus, and was composed of the
greater tenants, probably from teu to twenty in number,
each of whom, though differing in the arnount of their
holdings of the Lord, had to rovide a lodging at his
own expense within the Castis yard at Oardrff, eon-
neeted with their double capacity of defendere of the
Oastle in war, and advisers of its Lord in times of
peace. Eaeh, moreover, had his own castle, and some of
them were also Lords of mesne manors and castles,whose
tenants paid to them services similar to their own.

The Comitatus was a Court of Chancery or Record,
