Glemorgan, within the lordship. Ι1 was described
as “sicut regale”. Cardiff and the Taff were his Bungay
and Waveney3 and once there seated, 110 King of
Cockney could reach him. Ocyty, and at least one hill
lordship‚ comprising the two commotes of Senghenydd,
were held 01 him per baroniam ; Avan, the only im-
ortant lowland lordship in the hands 01 0 Welsh
iamily of rank, was held by sery'eantry. Most 01 the
manors were held directly 01 Cardiff b the tenure
of Oastle-guard; a few were held immediately 01 the
larger manors. All the greater tenente, with the
exception 01 the Lords of Avan and Senghenydd, and
perhaps one or two more, were 01 Norman blood, and
also held estates in England, chiefly within the Honour
01 Gloucester, within the counties 01 Gloucester, Semer-
set, Devon, and Dorset. The Liber Niger gives a list
01 the knights who held 01 1110 Honour, and in it occur
the names of twenty who also held lands in Glamorgan.
These are Berkerolles‚ de Oardiff, Co n, Constantine,
Orco, Grenville, de Londresr, Maisi, ela Mare, Ner-
bert, Norris, Pennard, Reigny, St. Quintia, Le Sere,
Somery, Umfranville‚ Villers, Walsh, and de Winton.
This list, moreover, for some unknown reason omits
0 number 01 other knightly tenants who held lands in
Devon‚ Domet, and Somerset, also within the Honour,

and many of whom 1101 only held lande but have given '

their names to parishes and manors in Glemorgan.
Such are Bawdrip, Hawey, de la More, St. John, and
Turberville, and m the latter elasa, Barry, Bonville,
Oantelupe, Fleming, and Sully.

As the Lorde of Glamorgan also held the Honour of
Gloucester, cases 01 divided allegiance were rare. Only
one suchis on record, where the Beauchamps 01 Haehe
claimed the wardship 01 Hawey, who held the manor
of Combe-Hawey in Somerset of the BeauchampS, and
that 01 St. Donate in Glamorgan 01 the Earls 01 Glou·
cester. The case came before the Comitatus, but the
finding is 1101 011 record. The only other ease in which
the proceedings before the Cannensem preserved re-
