ι Arclcoeolopic Ccmhrensrc, and in the copious though
incidentel notices of Wales in Eyton's excellent History
os Early Slaropslrirc, it is nottho material that is want-

share of the gifts of nature or of their adaptation to

· produce material prosperity. The incurvated coast,

whence the country is thought to darive its name,
abounds in bays and headlands of extreme beauty and
grandeur. In the North, its scenery is bold and strik-
1ng; in the South it is of a softer character, and celess
brated rather for its valleys than its mountaius, its
meandering rivers rather than its dashing torrenta.
ln mineral wealth the North is not deficient, but the
South has the lion's share, nor does any part of it
approach in value the division of Glamorgan. Here,
in the contre of the Welsh coal field, that mineral is
not only abundant in quantity, easy of access and con-
venient for trans ort hy sea,but it is of a character
equally removed fiom the bituminous varieties of the
east and the anthracite of the west, so that it produces
unusual steam power in proportion to its weight and
bulk, and does so without raising the usual accompani·
ment of smoke—-qualities which render it valuable in
commeree and still more in request in naval warfare.
Wales, moreover, and especially Glemorgan, was
for centuries the scene of romantio and spirit-stirring
eventa, and has had a large measure of ecclesiasticel
and military renown. To Pelagius, though their names
have the ‘⁴ merit of congruity”‚ 'the land of Morgan
cannot indeed lay olaim; and too many of her early

and in the fragmentary, but ancient literature of the
eople. Bede relatas how “Lever Mawr'', the “great
