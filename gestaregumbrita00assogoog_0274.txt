the Oyuon, and Tre-Herbert upon the Rhondda, tribu·
taries of the Taff, are the centres os immense nebulae
of population, at this time condensing with more than
Amerrcan rapidity into considerable towns. The actual
bounderies of the county, east and west, are the Afon·
Eleirch or Swan river, now the Rhymny, from Mon·
mouthshirc‚ and the Llwohwr or Burry from Caermar-

thenshire. The episcopal village and Cathedral of
Llandaff stand upon the Llcn or meed of the Taff, a
little above Oardiff.

The great natural division of the county is into up-
land and lowland, called hy the old Welsh the Blocnou
and the Bne: the latter extending, like the Ooncan of
Bombay, as a broad margin along the seaboard, and
covering about a third of the area3 the former, rising
abruptly like the Syhedree Ghauts, and lying to the
north. The Bro, thou h containing sea cliffs of a hun-
dred feet, is rather undulating than hilly3 the Blaenau
is throughout mountainous, ’ and contains elevations
which rise to 1300, l‚600, and, at carn Moysin, to

2,000 feet. From this high ground spring the rivers

of the county. Besides t e four already mentioned,
arethe Nedd, on which are the town of Neath and
the dock of Briton-Ferry, the El with the dock of
Penarth, the ngr flowing through Bridgend, and the
Cowbridge Thawe, whose waters roll into the sca over
a field of water-worn lias pebbles, in repnte as an
hydraulis limestonc‚ in great request among engiueers,
and as celebrated as that of Barrow on the Soar.
Besides these are a multitude of small streams bearing
Welsh names, some of which, as the Sarth or J avelin,
and the Twreh or Boar, are highly significant.

The Llwohwr is the only Glamorgan river admittin ,
in any de ee, of navigation, and that to every sm l
extent. he other streams are rapid and uncertain,
sometimes foeming torrents, sometimes dry beds of
shingle, but more commonly with a moderate flow
They descend through those wild and rocky but always
verdant valleyS, for which Glamorgan is justly iamed.
