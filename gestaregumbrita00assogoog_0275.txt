dardiff, the principal port of the county, is formed
by the union of the Taff and the Ely, and its roadstcad

sively worked: the lowlands are mainly old red sand-
stone and mountain limestone, more or less erodcd by
water, and covered up by the unconformable‚ and
nearly horizontal beds of the magnesian conglomerate,
the new red, and the 1133. The county contains no
igneous rocks nothing known older than the old red,

gravels‚ however, are on 3 large scale, and their sections
throw much light upon the origin and dip of the
