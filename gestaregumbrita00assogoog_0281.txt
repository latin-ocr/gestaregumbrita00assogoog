Mynydd Bychan, near Cardiff, at which J estyn was
slain. Einion's reward was the hill-lordship ol' Seng-
henydd‚ but in the Welsh tradition he is always stig-
matised as Einion-fradwr, “the traitor’'. J estyn was
also supported by Oedrych ap Gwaethfoed, Lord of
Cardigan, but closely connected with Glamorgan, and
ancestor of Lewis of Van and other of the older
familias in the east of the county.

The proceedings of Fitz·Hamon during and upon his
conquest have been woven into a legendary tale, very
neat and round, very circumstantial, ut as deficient in
evidence as though it had proceeded from the pen of
Geoffrey himself. The story, which in South Wales is
an article ol‘ saith, explains the jealousy between Rh s
and J estyn‚ resting, of course, upon a woman; tle
cause of the special selection of Ernion to bring in the
Normans; the battle of Hirwaun-Wrgan ;“ the death
of Rhys and his sons; the payrnent of the Nonnans in
gold ; the refusal to Einion of his guerdon; the retire-
ment and return of the Normans; the death of Jestyn
and the occupation of his territory; and, finally, its
partition between the conqueror and his twelve prin-
cipal followers, and four or five Welshmen.

By whom, or when this story was concootcd is not
known. It was certainly accepted without challenge
in the reign of Elizabeth, and could scarcely have been
circulated before the extinction ol the Le Despencers‚
early in the fifteenth century. Probabl its author
was sorno follower of the Stradlings of dt. Donats, a
family somewhat given to literature, whose fictitious
pedigree it sets forth as true. What is certain is
that whatever may have been the cause alleged, the
invasion was not really due to any local quarrel, but
was part of a settled olicy for completing the English
aliuiiiastultsternutabant
person, or by some of the adventurers who about the
same time were taking possession of Monmouth and

Breoknook and the whole of South-west Wales. ln-
