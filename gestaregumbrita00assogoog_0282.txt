deed, Rufus awaited the result of Fitz-Hamon’s ex-
pedition at Alveston, between Bristol and Gloucester,
and is supposed to have been only prevented by ill-
ness from bearing a share in it. A few months after
the main success there seems to have been a rising of
the Welsh in Weutloog, Glamorgan, and Gower, the
result of which, according to the Brut, was sofar
successful that it secured for them somewhat better
terms, of which, however, there is but little evidence
iu what is known of the disposition of the lands.

It is singular that of so notable a man as Fitz-Hamon
so little should be known. His father, “Hamo Den-
tatus’', seems to have received favours from Duke
William, who specially noticed his defection, with that
of N cel de St. Sauveur, Grimont de Plessy, and Ranulph
of Bayeux at Vale-Dones, as recorded in the Oronr'qne
des Duos de N ormondie :-

“ Par ool Rannol de Beiesin
E par N eel dc Costentin

Epor Hamus uns Antccriz
E par Grimout des Plaiseia

Felon, paijor e'tmltor
E vers Deu e vers lor Seignor
Neel, Hamun, Rauol, Grimont.''

In the battle, among the leaders, was ‘⁴ Haimonem
agnomine Dentatum”, who led the first line of six
thousand men and much distinguished himself, fighting
hand to hand with the King of Franoe, by whose
attendants he was slain. He is there called Sieur de
Thorigny‚ de Bersy, et de Oreully, and his war-cry
(according to the Roman de lton), was “ St. Amaut'’;

“Et Han-adens va reclamant,
‘St Amano, sire ‘Saint Amaut'.'’¹

Malmesbury speaks of Haimon as “Avum Roberti qui
nostro tempore in Anglia multarum possessionum incu-
bator extitit'', but he was more probably the father.

¹ St. hrmand was the patron saint of Thorigny‚ sometimes called
“ St.. Arnaml de Thorigny”. c 2
