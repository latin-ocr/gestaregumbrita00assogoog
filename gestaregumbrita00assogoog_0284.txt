negotiating 0 peace between the brothers. As Seig-
neur of Thorigny and Creully he was homager of
Robert,“Homme de Duc'’, as it was called, but he seems
thenceforward 10 have adhered to Henry, whom he
supported in 1101 against the “Optimates'', who sup
ported Robert. In that year the letter written by
Henry on his accession, to Anselm, is witnessed by
Robert Fitz-Hamon and Hamo Dapifer. In 1105 he
was captured during the siege of Bayeurr, taking refuge
in the Tour de Moustrier de Secqueville‚ which was
burned. Henry, however, obtained his liberation im-

he was wounded in the temple at the siege of Caen, of
which wouud he lingered till 1107, when he died.¹

Welsh divisione of cantreds and compotes were pre-
served, and usually the panchea, but by a modification
of these divisione the lordshi was divided into body

shire 100, and was placed under 0 sheriff ; and the
members, though extending at points into the low-
lands‚ corresponded for the most part to the ‘⁶ Blaenau''.
Besides these were the lord's private or demesne lands,

of Landaff.

The shire 100 01 body was settled in accordance with
the feudal system in use in Normandy. The private
estates became manors, and in many cases also pro-
bably new parishes. There were 36 and 3-5ths knights'
fees, divided into about twenty-six lordshi s, held by
castle-guard tenure of the Castle of caruil, to which
