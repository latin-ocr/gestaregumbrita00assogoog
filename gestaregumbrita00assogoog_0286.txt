title, there seems to have been an attempt for a time
to make Glamorgan the designation of the see. At
Bishop Urban’s consecration by Anselm he is called
Bishop of Glamorgan‚ and the same appears in Eadmer.
The Bishop, as head 01 110 Church 01 Llandaff, and
lord of that manor, had the prerogativae 010 Lord
Marcher‚ but his temporalities were confirmed to him
by the chief lord‚ who claimed to hold possession of
the see when vacant, though this right was afterwards
challenged hythe crown and surrendered. The Bishop
held the lordship of Llandaff and the manor 01 St.
Lythan, or Worlton, in the shire.

The lands given hythe Welsh princes to the colleges
of Llantwit and Llancarvan seem to have been trans-
ferred to other foundations3 for it is stated in the
cartulary of St. Peter's at Glouoester that Fitz-Hamon
gave to that House the church of St. Oadoc at Llan-
carvan, and Penhon, with fifteen hides of land, ro-
bably about 1102. Llancarvan is mentioned in 01011
01 Calixtus in 1119, and of Honorius 10 1128; and King
Stephon, in confirming lauds to Glouoester 10 1136,
mentions St. Oadoc of Llancarvan and Tregoff, among
the gifts 01 Fitz-Hamon. On the whole, the church
in the lordship had 00 reason to complain 01 110 new
lords The Benedictine Abbeys of Neath and Margam
were founded in 1130 and 1147, and their endowments
rapidly augmented. Ewenny, as 0 0011 01 Glouoester,
was founded about the same time, and therefore it
10 001 robable that Fitz-Hamon or his successor 000-
fiscated any church lands; and no doubt 110 10001 pro-
perty held by the Abbey of Glouoester, and afterwards
by their successore, the Dean and Chapter, represents
the old Welsh endowments.

The part playedb the Orown 10 110 conquest 01
Glamorgan has never licen clearly defined. Fitz-Hamon
certainly received the Honour of Glouoester to enable
him to undertake it. It is certain that he did so with
the consent of Rufus, and upon the condition that he
held the land, as such conquesta were elsewhere held,
