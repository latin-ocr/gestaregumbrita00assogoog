wardsilver3 and each had its customs‚ exemptione,
payments and quittances recorded in the chancery,
which it was the prerogative of every Marcher to hold,
attached to the court of his Caput Berenice, which took
cognisance‚ in the first instance or by appeal‚ of every
cause, civil or criminal, arising within its bounds.
There must, therefore, have been accumulated in the
several chanceries a mass of records similar to those
which, from the other parts of the kingdom, were pre-
served in the royal courts and the exchequer.

What then has become of these necorde, which were,
in fact, the early title deeds of the Welsh estates l It
is scarcely surprising that the records even of the most
powerful private families in Wales should have been
destroyed, so frequent were the incursione and retalia-
tions of the two parties, who, of course, bumed and
destroyed everything within their reach ; but this does
not apply in the same degree to the records of the
Marchers,wh0se castles were strong and well garrisoned‚
and in many casce, as at ChepstoW‚ LuleW, and
Shrewsbury, scarcel at all exposed to be talren and
sacked. Cardiff incl
of the Welsh; and Glcndowr, who was its last inveder
during its existence as a Marcher Lordship, is supposed
to have destroyed all he found, which may perhaps
account for the disappearance of the earlier records;
but even then there must have been many of a later
date, accumulated under the Beauchamps and Nevilles,

and J asper Tudor3 and these also are lost. The lord-
ship then reverted to the Orown, and as Edward VI

eed was once or twice in the hands ’

and Elizabeth, while selling the lands‚ retained the ’

seigniorial powers, it might be expected that their
officere would tolie charge of the records of the chan-
ce . Certainly there are very few in private hands,
auid it is understood that neither at Badminton, nor
Wilton, nor at Cardiff, are there any documents re-
lating to the seigniory of Glemorgan, or any relating
to Glemorgan, of earlier date than the entrance of the
Herherts into that seigniory.
