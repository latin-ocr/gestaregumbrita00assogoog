Some have suggested that when the Maroherships
were abolished or vested in the Crown, and the govem-
ment of Wsles was administered by the Council at
Lud10w‚ the reoords were all transferred thither, and
perished in the subsequent civil wars; others suppose
them to have been removed to the repositories in
London, and still to slumber unknown in that vest and
long neglected thou h valuable collection, a theory
which recent research renders searcel tenable. The
subject of the disappearance of the Syouth-Welsh re-
cords is one of considerable interest, and it is to be
hoped that it will be investigpetcd hy one of the able
¹ antiquaries on the staff of the cord Office,sinoe none
other could direct the necessary researches.

Fortunately for posterity‚ although the records of
the transactione of the Maroher Lords with their
tenants, of the Mareschals and De ClareS, the Mor-
timers, Montgomerys‚ NewmarchS, Bellomonts, Braoses‚
Bohuns and Hastings'3 with their knights and military
dependente, are lost, a better lot has attended the re-
cords of their transactione with the Orown3 and the
inquisitione taken upon their deaths or escheatS, and
the detail of their feudal services, are in great measure

reserved.

p Also‚ it has fortunately happened that the Maroher
Lords‚ from their detached position and great military
power, were frequently tempted into rebellion, and
their estates suffered forfeiture or escheat3 then, or
during a minority‚ the Orown stepped in and seized
llthhtltttttltlhlthlttl llttllht
= Crown, and the transactione were recorded in the re-
cords of the realm, and are preserved. Thus the
Honours of Gloucester and Breoknook were in the
hands of Herny I and Stephen. Richard and John
both held the Honour of Gloucester, and the cortpo-
tus roll returned by their officer gives much informa·
tion as to the internal state of Glarnorgan at that re-
mote period, which would otherwise have been lost.
