There is aleo another source, both copious and accu-
rate, of which little heed has hitherto been taken, but
which throws considerable light upon the names and
origin of the followers of Fitz·Hamon into Glamorgan.
It appears that almost all who joined in the conquest,
or settled in the conquered territory, came from the
Honour of Gloucester‚ and were therefore connected
with one or other of the shires of Gloucester‚ Semer-
set, Devon, Dorset, or Wilts; and as they were either
landowners‚ or the cadets of landowners‚ in those
counties, their names occur in the local records, which·
not unfrequently explain various particulare as to their
descent and connections.

Of the leading settlers, whose names occur in such
records as exist in Glamorgan, some certainly oon-
temporary with Fitz-Hamon, others who, or whose
fathore, may, many of them, be really of that date, de
Granville held lande at Bideford, Turberville at Bere·
Turberville, St. Quintin at Frome-St.-Quintin, Umfra·
ville at Down-Umfraville, Halwey at Combe-Halwey or ·
Hawey, Reigny at Esse and Oulm-Reigny, Bawdrip at
Bawdrip, Cogan at Huntepill, Bonvile at Bonvileston in
Dev0n; while Barry, Bawcen, Butler, Corbet, Dennis,
Fleming, Joel, Le Sore, Luvel, Maisy, Norr'm, Payn,
Sandford, Scurlage, Stmmy, St. John, Valognes‚
Walsh, and scores of others, occur in various parts of
the Honour, and are found in either the eleventh,
twelfth, or thirteenth centuryin Glamorgan.

Many of the settlers reversed the usual practice in
England, and, as in Ireland, gave to their lands their
own names ; sometimes, it may be, because they found
the Welsh name hard to pronounce; more frequently
because their castles and the limite of their estates
were altogether new Thus Bany, Bonvileston,
Flemingston, Oolwinston, Constantineston or Coston,
Gilest0n‚ Laleston, Nicholaston, Maraces, Sully, all
names of parishes, were evidently taken from their
lordS, and possibly were carved out of earlier Welsh
parishes, which were usually very large indeed. St.
