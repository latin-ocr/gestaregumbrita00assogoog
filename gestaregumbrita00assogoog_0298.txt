Henry ΙΙΙ. Every landowner’s house was literally
his castle. In parts of Glamorgan they stood so close
that it is difficult to understand whence their owners
derived their revenues. For example, within a radius
os six miles from Barry, half the circle being occupied
by the sea, were twelve castles; and in the oounty,
and mainl in its southern part, were from thirt to
forty, of wlieh but one, Aberavan, belonged to a Wblsh
Lord. Most of these castles were the residences of
private persone, and were built for the defense of the
estate and its tenants; others, the property of the chief
Lord, were constructed for the defense of the country,
and were so placed as to command the passes by which
the Welsh were accustomed to descend upon the plain.
The sites of most of the Glamorgan castles are known,
and of many of them the ruins remam, though they
rarely contain masonry of an earlier date than the reign
of Henry ΙΙΙ. Oardiff, however, boasts a shell keep of
Norman date, as is probably its immense outer wall,
attributed to Robert Earl of Gloucester. The annale
of Margom attribute the bussffinffif the town of Cardiff
to the previous reign, but Car ‘ is certainly a much
older place, and probably was founded when the Roman
road was laid out, to guard the passage of the River
Taff. The earthworks of the Oastle were originally
rectangular‚ and probably the work of the Romanised

invaders from England. Ogmore has a square keep
of undoubted Norman pattern, doubtless the work of

the first or second de Londres; and at Penllyne are
fragments of a similar keep, containing some curicus,
and it may be, early, herring-bone work, ang possibly
