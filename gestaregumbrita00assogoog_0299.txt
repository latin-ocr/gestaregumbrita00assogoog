Earl Robert’s work, and so a little earlier than even
Robert Norris, who seems to have been the first, or
a very early, grantae. At N ewcastle by Bridgend are
the gateway and the original wall of a castle, certainly
early, because it gives name to the parish, and the
masomy of which is evidently of Norman date and
very peculiar in the pattern of its mouldings. Here, as
enerally in the Norman buildings in Glamorgan,
{otton stone is employed. It is uncertain by whom
Newcastle was built. The name of Oldcastle is pre-
served in the adjacent town of Bridgend, though
where it precisely was, or what it was, is not known.

Of Early English castles the rectangular keep at
Fonmon, still inhabited, is the best, and indeed the
only tolerably perfect example. The base of the tower
of Whitohuroh is in that style, as is part of Ocyty;
and in tha foundations of Sully Castle, opened some
{ttattt liriniaiildnllll fgcggpgveysgng
masonry of Early English aspect is walled in, and is
probably part of the castle of Arnold Butler.

During the troubled reign of Henry ΙΙΙ, a great age
for castle building in WaleS‚ many strong places in
Glamorgan seem to have been renewed. Castell Cooh
and anrphilly were then built; and to that reign or
that of Edward I are due the fine gateways at Neath

and Llanblethian, a smaller one at Bamy, parts of

Oardiff and Morlais‚ the ancient wall of St. Fagans,
ι and probably the hagment at Llantrissant3 The gata

of Coyty. Besides theseos doubtfir date are Dinas
