parts of Kenfig, Peumark‚ and Oastleton, the ditches
and a few fragments of Talavan and Bonvileston, and
the foundations of Llanquian. Avan, Wenvoe‚ and
Wrinston are utterly gone. At Van, Beaupre, Cogan-
Pill‚ Cardiff, Oadoxton, West Orchard‚ Aberthin,
Llanveithin‚ Llanvihangel, Llantrithyd, Pencoed, Caer-
wiggau, Sutton, and Llancayach are ancient houses,
some very perfect. Carnllwyd is excellent Decorated,
as is Oantleston and art of F limston, where the court
hae an embattled w . At Castell-y-Mynach are re·
mains of the Hall, and in the walls of the Manorial
House of Talygarn, lately recast, were found windows
of the time of Henry V.

Many of the churcheS, and notably the cathedral,
contain Norman work; and in others, where the church
has been rebuilt‚ the font and the holy water stoop, on
a stunted column, are of that date. Throughout the
lordship most churchyards retain the polygonal stepped
baseos across, and of some such crosses the shaft is
preserved, and of one or two the actual carved stone
which formed the apex, and represented the crucifixion.
In the churchyard of St. Donate is one of these crosses '
of remarkable elegance. It hasbeen copied at Llandaff,
but in dimensione, and laced in a position, entirely fatal
to its effect. There also remain a few of the upright
shafts of crosses of an earlier date, carved in bold basket
work patterns, and usually set upright in the ground
without base or pedestal. Time, neglect, and the
labonm, not uncalled for, of the diocesan architect are
annually bringing about the destruction of these re-
mains and, what ie, archaeologically, much the same
thing, the restoration of the ancient edifices.

The entry and yeomanry of the lordship, that is,
those who have any real claim to antiquity of desccnt‚
are still divided into the pure Welsh and the descend·
ants of the Norman settlers. The genealogies of these
settlers, “ Advenae'' as they are styled in the local
pedigree books, are scarcely so well preserved as those

of the corresponding class in England‚ but their estates
