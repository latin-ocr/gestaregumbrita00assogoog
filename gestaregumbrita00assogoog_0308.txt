10 Pembrokeshire, and by her husband, Gerald de

Windsor‚ was ancestress 01 that famil ‚ who derived
their surname from their office 01 1100101100 01 Windsor
Oastle. Lappenberg, who accepts Nest as Robert's
mother, thus accounts for the number 01 Welsh who
followed him 10 the battle of Lincoln, and Palgrave
rests upon it a circumstantial narrative, but there is no
Ι {vidence for the fact, which moreover was not accepted
Dugdale.
yThe dates 01 Robert’s birth and marriage are unre-
corded, and can only be inferred. He was certainly
born before his father's accession in 1100, 0οᾶ he seems
to have been the eldest 01 Henry's many natural chil-
dren. Henry himself was born in 1068. Robert’s
daughter was married to the Earl of Ohester shortly
before the battle 01 Lincoln in 1141, butas women
were then married early, this proves little. In 1140,
according 10 the Gesta Stephani, after the capture 01
the Devizes‚ Robert's son was sent to share the custody

01 the eastle. About 1142, Philip, another 000, 10 spoken

01 as taking an active part 00 10 fathor's side, and he
was married to a 01000 or granddaughter 01 Rogcr de
Berkeley. Supposing Philip born about 1120, and not
the eldest son, it seems possible that Robert may have
married 00 early 00 1116-17, or even a few years earlier.¹
Such is the conclusion of Mr. Floyd, who has worked
out the point with his usual sagacity. This would give
the admmistration of the estates to the Crown for about
ten years. 11 the marriage took place in 1117, the lady,
Fitz-Hamon’s eldest daughter, could not have been less
than fourteen, and was probably nearer twenty. Hemy
was no doubt well aware 01 the great abilities of his son,
and thought him a safe man to wield so great and
peculiar a power.

The wooing was conducted by the King in person,
and, iffaithfully related by Robert of Gloucester, gives
a high 001100 01 the lady's good 00000 :-
