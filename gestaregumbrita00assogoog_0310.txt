the nativas, the real work of organizing and administer·
ing the conquest, and providing delences for the con·

uered territory, seems to have been in a great measure
t e work of Earl Robert. Fitz-Hamon must necessarily
have provoked much persona] enmity, and his close at·

Earl- Robert, on the other hand, was not associated

bordering on the hillo, the jurors were almost all
Welshmen. Tha conquest was, however, far too re-
cent, and the Welsh spirit far too jealous of control, to
allow the lord’s authority to rest alone upon an equit-
able system of ovemment. Earl Robert, who is known
to have built ristol Castle, is reported also to have
built that of Cardiff, and the material evidence of the
