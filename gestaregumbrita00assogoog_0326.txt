for disobedienoe of orders. Wardships formed a regular
portion of the Lord's ravenue. One occurs in the per-
son of the daughter of Guy de Trotiugton, whose land¹

is in the Lord's hands. A relief also is paid by Robert
de Cardiff on obtainin seizin of his land, and a fine
is levied upon Alon de {t Georgo, probably on a similar
oooasron.

In 1184 Henry was at Woroester on South Wales'
affaire. Rhys ap Griffith had a safe conduct and came
to the Kin , and promised his sons and nephews as
hosteges. ihs ‚however, refused to redeem the pro·
mise. It is rather strange, after what had passed, that
Howel of anrleon should be in the King’s service
against his countrymen.

In 1185 the Welsh,unrestrained by any giving of hos-
tages, took advantage of the interregnum, and invaded
and laid waste Glamorgan. Aneoli se, which presented
the sun of the colour of blood, no doubt was construed
in their favour. They burned Kenfig for the second
time-‘⁴ it had not been burned a year or more”-and
the town os Cardiff. Neath was attached, but relieved
by the Normans, who beat off the swarm of Welshmen,
and bumed their manhines of war. It was then that, at
Llanridian in Gower, St. Iltyd's spring flowed with
milk, and that of so excellent a qualissy that butter rose
upon its surfaee. In this year W· am, Prior of St.
Augustine's, became Bishop of Llandaff, and in 1187
ognseorated the altar of the Holy Trinity in the Abbey
o Mar vn.

On tgham 6th July 1189, Kin Henry died, the lord-
ship being still in the hands olgthe Orown.
