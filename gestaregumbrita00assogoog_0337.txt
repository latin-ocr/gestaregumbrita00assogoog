Henry ΙΙΙ, Hubert married Margaret of Sootland. He
does not appear as Earl 01 Gloucester; robably he had

not ‘time to fulfil the necessary form ities. He was 1
created Earl 01 Kent llth February 1227, with re-
mainder to his heirs by Margaret.

Isabel having died ohildless, the inhsritance passed,
