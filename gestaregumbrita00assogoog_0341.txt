Glsuusnsn Crispin‚ the real founder of the Clare

family, was the son of Gonnum or Goisfred, Comte d'Eu r

and de Brionne‚ a natural son of Rloflnnn the elder,

Duke of Normandy. In the foundation charter of Bec ³

Abbey, about 1034, he describes himself as “Gislebertus

earldoms are involved in muohobscurity. Gislebert
could scarcely have been Earl of the territory of

Brionne‚ for his son continued to use the title of Comes ’

aster Brionne had been alienated. Probably it was

personal. The sobriquet of Crispin was borne by
another, also distinguished, Norman family, of whose
¹ founder the Monk of Bec records that he had “capillos
crispos et rigidos, atque sursum erectos, et ut ita dicam,
rebursos ad modurn pini ramorum, qui saepe tendunt
sursum”. Hence the name of “Crispinus, quasi crispus
pinus'', and such we ma suppose to have been the
character of the “chevelirre'' of Godfrid’s immediata

descendants. The county of Eu was taken from Gisle- ,
bert by his kinsman Duka Richard II, and given to ¹
Gislebert’s uncle, William. Brionns he retained, and J
Sap, said to he so called from a “sapin'’, or fir tres, ¹
planted in frent of the church there. He was one of ,

the youplg William's gowernors, but was assassinated· in
1035. rs sons were Richard and Beldwm, who, with

his brother “Ricardus filius Comitis Gisleberti'', wit· l

From him the Earls of Devon inherited Okehampton.
