Hertford is uncertain, but the reservation of the third
penny in the fec-farm rente paid by the eheriff of the
county shows it to have been either late in the reign of
Hemy I, or very early in that of Stephen. As to the
limitation, the patent for the earldom is not extant,
but possibly it would be held now that, like that of
Oxford, it was confined to the heire male of the body,

because, on the death of Gilbert de Clare in 1314, his ¹
sistere did not take it. Gloucester, however—almost a y

contemporary title-descended, as hae been seen, on
three occasions to heire female, and b the courtesy of l
England, was assumed by their husbande Earls Al-
maric, De Magnaville, and De Clare. King John, who
assumed the title with the junior co-heirese, ie said to
have been created Earl of Gloucester, but that this was
unneceseary ie clear, for D'Evreux and De Clare, whose
mothers were the other sistere, successively bore, and
the latter transmitted, the title. N everthelese, on the
death of Gilbert de Clare, Glouceeter, like Hertford,
was held to be extinct. The Despcneers, husband and
son of the elder oo-heir, did not claim it, and Audley,
the husband of the next co-heir, obtained it only by a

new creationes did a more remote Desponser. lt κ

seems, therefore, that the practice had changed, and
that earldoms which had formerly passed with heire
female did eo no longer. It must be remembered, with
respect to the earldcm of Hertford, that there had been
no earlyo portunity of roving its limitation, as the
male line lad never failed.

Earl Richard seems to have paid much attention to
his South Wales possessione, and he, like his grandsire,
met with his death from the nativeS, it iesaid from
Morgan ap Owen, in the disturbances that broke out
after the death of Henry I, in 1135. His death ie sup-
posed to have occurred 1n 1139; eo that his enjoyment
of the title of Hertford must have been brief. He was
buried at St. Neot’s. He married Christiana, sister of
Ranulph, Earl ol Cheeter, whose name, unknown to
Dugdale, occurs in her husband’s charter to Bury
