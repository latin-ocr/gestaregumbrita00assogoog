as Richard Earl of Clare, witnessed letters by Richard I
aoth March 1190, and 17th April 1194, and another
document, 7th June 1199. lst John he married
Amice, daughter and co—heir of William, Earl of
Glouoester, whose inheritance neither he nor his wife
lived to possess. To her, as to her sister Mabel,

Amice seems to have died before 1226, the date of the
