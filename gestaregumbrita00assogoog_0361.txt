sion ol' force at Gloucester, crossed the Severo, and
marched on Hereford His object seems to have been
'to attach from the west the Earl Mareschal's chief
castle os Chepstow, and his plan to descend the valley
of the Usk, taking advantage of the support of J ohn of
Monmouth, to whom belonged that town end eestle,
and of Morgan of Caerleon, who held the lowlands of
Gwent‚ aud thus to inte se between the Earl, who
