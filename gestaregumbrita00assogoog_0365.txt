102 THE Lanu OF MORGAN:

in ,charge of Glamorgan, to which, l7th J uly, Swansea

was ad ed; and that this carried the lordship of Gower
with it, appears from a precept on the Close Roll in-
forming Siward that because the Kin understands
that the “ maritagium'' of Agnes, daughter and heir
of William Mara, pertains to Margaret de Braose as
part of her dower, the 2100 fine which Robert de

emis made for her with Peter de Rivanx is to be
paid over to Margaret. Rivaux had evidently usurped
the “maritagium’' from Margaret, and Siward as custos
is to redress the wrong.

With the rest, the King extended his favour to the
Barons of the Honour of Gloncester, Roger Berkerollea
Roger de Hide, Gilbert de' Turberville, Richard Pin·
cerna, William Flandrensis, Wydo wan, and Hoel son
of Archid, the two bailiffs of Swansea‚ Re mund de
Sully, John de St. John, and Gilbert de llmfreville.
l7th J uly, Richard Lelande was ordered to inspect the
lands held by H. de Burgh as guardian of the Earl of
Clare, and to report how they had been held by Peter
de Rivanx and Richard Passelewe. This seems to have
been preparatory to the handing them over to a new
guardian. Siward's appointment was in fact tempo-
rary‚ and nard J anuary 1235, he had a safe conduct to
surrender the lordship to Gilbert, Earl of Pembroke,
who was admitted aeth February, and having been
allowed the title and estates of his late brother,
Riohard Mareschal, waS, llth June, girded with the
sword of the earldom. For the wardship of his ne·
pheW, and the lordship of Glamor n, during the re·
mainder of the minority‚ he fine 500 maros This
acquisition placed the whole seaboard from Chepstow
to Pembroke and Aberystwith, Gower alone excepted
in the hands of Earl Gilbert. Among those now re-
stored were John de St. Quintia, who was to have his
castle of Llanblethian and other lands in Glamorgan,
