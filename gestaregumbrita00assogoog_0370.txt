The Abhot refused to allow this3 upon which Thomas

excepting the tithe sheaves. On this Roger sued the
Abbot before the comitatus. Roger had an uncle Rhys,
and was otherwise well-supported, so the Abbot offered
him a pension of five marce, which at the Earl's re-
quest was raised to sir, but still was refused as insuf-
ficient. The Abbot, as a safeguard, took letters of
protection from the Earl, addressed to the vicecomes.

The Earls returned from the Holy Land early in
1242, but the Earl of Gloucester was probably too
young to take part in the fierce discussion that then
arose in Parliament, as to assisting the Kiug to recover
his foreign possessions. No doubt his sympathies were
with his stepfather, the Earl of Cornwall, but nothing
is heard of him before the lth August 1243, when he
was of full age. A message was sent to Henry, then
on the continent, pressing him to give seizin of the
estates by letter. This he declined to do, and the
Earl actually had seizin at Winchester 29th August,
and, finally, 23rd September, the Kiug accepted his
homage. (Plcc. Coros„ arth Hen. ΙΙΙ.) With his
other lands he received those which his mother, the
Oountess of Oomwall, had held in dower. In this
transaction the convent of Tewkesbu became his
“ fidei jussores’' in 300 maros to the Emrfof Cornwall,
and in return took a bond of indemnity from the
young Earl. A little earlier, the 25th of March, the
Abbot of Tewkesbury gave to Rely Morgan a yearly
pension of two maros until he should provide him with

a better benefice, and Rely gave up his pension from
Llandough, into which he had been inducted by Arch-

deacon Maurice, his unclc.
