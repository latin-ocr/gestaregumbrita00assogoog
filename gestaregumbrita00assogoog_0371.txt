108 rna nano or nonem:

2nd September 1243, the Earl’s eldest son, Gilbert,
was born at Christchurch in Hampshire. It was in
this year that Hawise de Londres, heiress of the great
Lordships of Kidwelly and Ogmore, married Patrio de
Chaworth, and laid the foundation of a valuable part
of the after Duchy of Lancaster. He fell in battle
