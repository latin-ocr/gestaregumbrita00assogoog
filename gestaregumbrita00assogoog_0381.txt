patched up between them by the Earl of Hereford and
others, no doubt in consequence of the King's rocla-

mation of the 28111 of March. Gloucester sent erwin,

law plea which had lasted nine years and five dayS,
and in the same mouth he either preceded or accom-

resignation of N ormandy, and to settle some other
