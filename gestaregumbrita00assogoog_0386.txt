THE EARLS OF GLOUGESTER AND HERTFORD. 123

On the Earl's death, Nicholas Berkcley‚ and after·
ward Petronel de la Mare, took charge of the Honour.

return “de maneriis quae idern comes nomine custodiae

Earl itichard died at a very critical period in his
own career and in the history of his country. His
rank and alliances, his immense roperty, and his
power in the Welsh Marches made iim a most impor-
tant person, second only to King Henry and his
brother the King of the Romans. The moderatiori
of his character in a reign continually verging upon
civil war placed him in opposition, sometimes to one
party, sometimes to the other, and probably neither
Henry nor Prince Edward‚ nor Simon de Montfort
thought him to be relied upon. He died just when
it would have been absolutely necessary to take a
decided part, and had he lived, that pert would pro-
bably have been with the King. He was personally
breve, and experienoed in the use of arms and in
warfare. ’

The lordship of Glamorgan fell into the King's
hands, the young Earl being a minor. Hurn hrey de
Bohun at once took charge, and reported to the King,
who acknowledged his letter, and committed to him,

Kaerdiff, Lantrissan, Langenyth, Neth, and all other
fortalices and their appurtenances in Wales. Philip
