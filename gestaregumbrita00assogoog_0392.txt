THE EARLS OF GLOUCESTER AND HERTFORD. 129

and the Prince fell back upon the Severn at Glouoester.
While there, he learned that the younger de Montfort
was on his way from Pevensey towards Kenilworth.
With a decision that indicated the future leader, tbe
Prince by a rapid march interce ted de Montfort near
Kenilworth, routed him, l6th J uly, and thence turning
back upon Worcester, held that city and broke down
the bridge, lst August, and on the tth, encountered
and overthrew Earl Simon at Evesham.

In the battle, de Clare, as at Leues, led the second
line, but now on the King’s behalf. His reward was a

the King remitted 2900 of fine as yet unpaid upon
his livery‚ on the ground of his expenses in the royal

elected Bishop; and Griffith a Rhys, taken prisoner,
was committed to Cardiff casile, and thence, 1n 1267,
sent to Kilkenny for greater security. Towards the
close of 1266 Glouoester, himself discontented‚ seems
to have met the “disinherited'’ party in the Isle of
Ely, and thence, 8th April 1267, to have led them to
London, where they occu ied the city, and summoned
the Legate to surrender the Tower. They met publicly
at St. Paul's, but, meantime, Henry had advanced from
Windsor, and encamped at Stratiord, whence, oth May,
he also entered London. On this, Glouoester, through
his brother ThomaS, again made terms, and in June
he and his followers were admitted to the benefits of
the Bau, and a sale-conduct issued in favour of Gilbert
