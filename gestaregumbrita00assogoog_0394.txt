THE EARLS OF GLOUCESTER AND HERTFORD. 131

his subjecte, according to the lerms agreed upon. The
result was a compromise, agreed to aa Michaelmas
1268. The violence complained of had chiefly lain in
the districts of Senghenydd, Glyn·Rhondda‚ and Miscin,
tracas of country too strong and too near Cardiff to be
left in native hands The compromise lasted bul a
short time, and the final result was the building of the
great Oashle of anrphilly. The Earl was still bena
upon the recovery of Bristol; and, 3lsl October 1268,
he addressed the King‚ stating thar he proposed,
with Prince Edward's consent, to have his right to ’
the casile and borough tried in course of law, and
should he recover io, he promises to give due ex-
change. The suit seems to have been deferred till
1276, when, in the presence of the Archbishop of
Canterbury and others, the casule and borough were
adjudged to the King.

Ayear later, rethOeaber1269,the Earl had a safe-
oonduct to come to meet the King, Prince Edward, and
Llewelyn‚ of which he does nol seem lo have availed
himself ; nor did he attend the Parliament then held.
He found it very inconveniens to accompany the Prince
uo the Holy Land, and he probably feared compulsion.
The reason he assigned, whether true or false, was cer·
lainly sufficient. “Aa Comes causatus esf ferris suia
quae Walliae continguntur, et quae lunc temporis a
Wallensibus fortiter fuerunt impugnatae, depopulatis
provinciis, occasuris solo terrarum complanatis peri-
cnlum imminere, si, vacuatis regni limitibus, ipsas. . .
expositas relinqueret indefensas.” The King of the
Romans seems to have mediated, and ab Pentecost
1270, Henry allowed the repayment of ’che Earl's
expenses ab Evesham and again gave him livery of his
lands and casales. In return, he underlook to follow
the Prince, who had left England in J uly, unless pre-
vented by illness, war, or other sufficient causes This
he did not do, butas he gave no other cause of offence‚
he and Henry lived on good terms for the rest of the
reign. ·
