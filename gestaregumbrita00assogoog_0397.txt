Britain of the concentric style of fortresa and in arca
and accommodatiori second only to Windsor. Unfor-
tunately for its historic celebrity, the precautions which
led to its construction were, within a very few years,
rendered useless hythe complete conquest of the Prin·

Earl Gilbert certainly did not take up the defense of
his territory by halves Besides Caerphilly‚ the small
but strong fortress of Castell Coch was constructed to
guard the lowest pass of the Taff ; and upon the high
ground near one head of the same river, near the old
Roman way from Newport to Brecon, was constructed,
¹ a few years later, Morlais, a castle small in area but
strong, and guarded by a ditch quarried with immense
lahour out of the limestone rock. The chain was com-
pleted by the construction of a circular tower, now de-
stroyed, at Whitchurch, in the plain between Castell
Coch and Cardiff. The age of Castell Coch can he de-
termined only by reference to its architectural pecu·
liaritieS, which, however, are sufficiently marked.
Enough remained of Whitchurch a score ol years ago
to declare its date; but it is also mentioned in the
reign of Edward ΙΙ, when Llewelyn ap Griffith, repre-
sentative of the celebrated Ivor Bach, and ancestor of
the Lewises of the Van and Llanisheu‚ indigenous in
those parts, claimed and was allowed the “forcelettum’'
which stood upon his ground. Morlais, the site of
which had been wrested from the same Llewelyn, was
the subject of quarrel between the Lords of Brecknock
and Glamorgan in the reign of Edward I, the full par-
ticulare of which are recorded upon the Rolls of Parlia-¹
ment. Caerphilly was certainly built in the closing
years of the reign of Henry ΙΙΙ, though largely altered
and improved half a century later. Much of it bears
evidence of having been built in haste, though the
interior and more ornate parts are in good taste and of
excellent workmanship. In a military point of view it
is a very remarkable work.
