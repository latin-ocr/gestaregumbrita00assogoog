petition for divorce; and the Earl, anth May 1282,
settled upon her, ae the Ledy Alicia de Marchia, cer·
tain lande as a provision for her suetenance; their
daughter Isabel was also provided for. The pro-
ceedinge‚ however, seem, according to a deed in
Rymer,not to have been completed until l6th May 1285.
ι The object for which the divorce was brought about
could have been no secret, for in May 1283, is dated
the “Praelocutio” between the King and the Earl,

eleven years old. The consummation of the marriage
was on thie account postponed, and took place at Weet·
minster, 2nd May 1290, she being then eighteen years
