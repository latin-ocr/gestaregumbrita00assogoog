Wales, which had long obtained, bywhich,when conten-
tione arose between such magnates as held of the King
“in capite'’‚ before any suit was lodged in the King’s
Oourt, there should be taken “dies amoris sive Parlia-
menti'’‚ also called a “dies Marchiae”, when the causes of
the quarrel were to be laid before the neighbours and
common friends, acting as judgeS‚ so that the custom of
the March thus. might be cleared up.

The proceedings upon the main inquiry are recorded
at great length on the Rolls of Parliament, and were
one of the “causes celebres' of the reign. Before seu-
tence was given the Earl of Gloucester had married the
King's daughter, but the Earl of Hereford was also
connected with the royal family. In truth‚ the occasion

was a good one to break down the power of the Marcher

llereford had married the King's cousin, and his child-
ren were of kin to the King’s children, his forfaiture
also was limited to his life. Both were imprisoned‚
and Gloucester‚ besides paying 2100 to Hereford for
his losses was fined 10,000 maros to the King‚ and
Hereford 1,000 mares. Even the Earl’s officers, who
