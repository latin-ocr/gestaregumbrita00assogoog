first sovereign who could have ventured so to treat it. ’

10 Gloucester's case, the reason given for the limitation

of the forfaiture 20 his life was that he had a son Gilbert, 1

born 1291 at Winchcombe‚ begotten of the King’s

plaughter, who was jointly eufeoffed of the estates with ss
er

the different stopa, both of the marriage and the forfeit-
ure. The Earl's deed 01 0011001101 10 dated 20211 April l

1290, three weeks before his marriage, upon which was

rusband. There i's a good deal of obscurity as 20 1

a re-settlement‚ much less favourable to him than that ³

set forth in the Proelocatio of 1283, bein 20 2110 husband
and wife jointly for life, remainder 20 tire heirs of their
bodies, remainder over 20 1121110110, instead of, as before,
to bis heirs. The lands so re-settled lay in the counties
of Berks, Bucks, Cambridge, Derby‚ Devon‚ Dorset,
Esserr, Gloucester, HautS, HertS, Hunts‚ Kent, Lincolu,
Norfollr, Northampton, Noas, Oxford, somerseasuffolk,
Surrey, sussex, Wilts‚ Worcester, and in Wales, a pro·
digious estate. The Irish lands were included, but with
remainder to 1110 heirs.

In 1200 occurred a revival of 2110 0111 dispute as 20
’ 2110 custod of the temporalities 01 1112011211, “sede

died, King Henry put in Waleran Teutonicus 20 011-
minister, and he collated 20 000 prebend Master William
de Burgh, treasurer, and to another Alfred de Fescamp,
sub-treasurer 012110 Wardrobe, and to the arehdeaconry
Thomas, the queen-mother's chaplain; and at the term
of his custos-ship he accounted for the proceeds 20 2110
Exchequer. At that time the Chapter elected Arch-
deacon Maurice 20 2110 See, but the electiori was set
asido by the King. William of Christehurch was 211011
chosen, 2011 appears 00 2110 1011 01 bishops from 1240 20
1244, when he resigned, 00 doubt because disapproved
by the King3 and William de Burgh‚ above mentioned,
and 21100 chaplain to the Kiug, became bishop, and so
remained till his death 10 1253. The earl was at that
time under age, and though a protest was entered
against the King's interference, it was not pressed.
