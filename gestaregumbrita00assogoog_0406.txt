THE EARLS OF GLOUCES'I’ER AND HERTFORD. 143

Bishop William de Braose died, it appears, l9th
March 1286-7, when the Archbishop of Oantcrbury
revoked the commission of Master Thomas de St.
Andomard as official of Llandaff, and appointed Master
Aniamo Calue (l) then a canon of St. Asaph. On the
Bishop’s death, or soon afterwards, the Marober Lords‚
under whom the lands of the See were holden‚ took
possession of them. The Earl of Glouoester took
Llandaff and Llancader-Warden mauors, Lord William
de Braose took Bishopston in Gower, and the Earls of
Herel'ord and Norlollr‚ and Edmund the King's brother,
took others November 3rd, 1290, the lling's escheator,
Malcolm de Harley, raised objection to this, and, the
See bein still vacant, claimed the custody of the mauors
for the grown. De Braose and the others gave way,
but Gloucester stood up sor his rights. He asserted
the whole “patria'’ of Glamorgan to be “dominio su0'',
and all wardshipS, that os the See included, to belong
to him, as they had always belonged to his ancestors‚
save when under age, and the lord had, on that account,
been a ward to the King. He stated that his father
Richard, had, at his death, actually been in possession
of the manors in question, the See being then vacant.
The Earl was, no doubt, in his right, but the Kin had
him at a disadvantage, and his object was certainly for
the good of the realm, so the Earl had to give way, and
did so in October 1290 ; but to make the cession more
palatable a special grant, 2nd November 1292 (Ryley
says October 1290), of the privileges for their joint
and several lives was made to the Earl and Countess
J oan, with remainder to the King and his heirs for ever.
This case was cited in 1293 against John de Warenne,
Earl of Surrey, who claimed the custody of the tern-

oralities of St. Asaph. Of de Clare and the other
lords, it was said, “Niohil clamare poterunt, propter
privilegium regium, et corone dignitatem, ad quam
