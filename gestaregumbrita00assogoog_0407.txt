which the great King carried out measures that affected

the unity 01 his kingdom.
5th July 129 lRichard de Tonsmere, chaplain, was
instituted 10 the Church of High Anvolle (Highlight),

on the 10000101100 01 David de Someri its lord, by the
archbisliop, the See being vacant. 3rd September 1294,
John Gordon was custos of the temporalities 01 Llandaff,
and the Abbot 01 Margam collector 01 1110 current
subsidy. The dispute between the King and the Earl
will account 101 1110 uncertainty as 10 the occupancy 01
the See 110110001287 001112196, when John de Mon·
mouth was appointed, but 1110 King had to interfere 10
10100 the Earl to give him seizin. On another occasion,

1129 -2, the Earl seems to have taken the law into his
own 1100110, 10 1110 case 01 0 trespass committed by the
Earl 01 Norfolk upon his 1000010 01 Usk and Trilleck.
Arbitrators were named who were 10100 001 the inqui-

as an encroachment. This was settled by an agree-
ment signed at Tewkesbury, October 1291, by which
the Bishop‚ 01 10 his absence the Prior and Chapter 01
Worcester, were to have annually from tho Earl two
101 buoks and two fat does.

The King's determination to put an end to the privi-

leges 01 1110 Marcher Lords, no doubt led others to ,
contest them. Thus, the Prior 01 Goldcliff summoned 1

1110 Εο11 10 appear at bis 001111 01 N ewport 10 answer
101 trespass. The Earl neglected 10 appear, aud stated
that the King knew how he was engaged at 1110 11010
01 the first summons, and that as 10 1110 second, he
knew not whether he had received it or not·, but, when
pressed, he claimed time, on the plea that his wardrobe,
no doubt containing, or supposed to contem, records
01 his chancery, was 10 the parts 01 Wales.
