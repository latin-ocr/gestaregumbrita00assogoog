“Rex de Snowdoun per Walliam progrediens, occiden-
talem intravit Glanmorgan.'' The Earl must indeed have
seen that his Marcher kingdom was at an end, and
that, too, just when he had attained the highest object
01 a subject's ambition-a marriage with a daughter
01 the sovereign. At the close 01 this memorable year,
7th December 1295, 24111 Edward I, he died, in the
Oastle 01 Monmouth, aged fifty-two years, and having
held the earldom thirty-three years, On the 22111101

By Alice de la March he had a daughter, Isabel,
born lOth March 1261. She married Maurice Lord
Berkeley, 1304-5. She seems to have been granted
the custody 01 certain lands held by the King by reason
of the nonage 01 Giibert, son and heir of Gilbert Earl
01Ι (11011οο0101, etc. In 1314, Roger Mortimer 01 Wig-
more admitted a debt due to her 01 300 marce. She
also held lands contingent on her stepmother's death ;
101 in 1315 Ralph de Monthermer‚ Countess Joan's
husband, did service 101 certain lande which 01101-
wards devolved on Isabella. Also in 1327-8, being
Berkeley's widow, she petitioned, stating that her
brother, Earl Gilbert, had granted her the manors of
Shipton and Barford, 101 the restitution 01 which she

rayed. She was to show her charters. Berkeley had
been justiciary in SouthWaies, and custos of the castles
there. Isabel seems to have died childless 1338.

By his second wife, J oan 01 Αο10, the Earl had a
son, Gilbert, born 1291, and three daughters, Eleanor,
01 Alienon Elizabeth and Margaret, afterwards co-
heiresses of the estate, 10 the exclusion 01 their half·
sister Isabel, who was, no doubt, ousted by the sur·

against the inheriting by the half blood.
