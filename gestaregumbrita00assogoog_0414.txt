titles and the enyoyment of his estates.

One of Edwards first acts was to recal Gaveston, and
to give him the earldom of Cornwall, and Margaret,
one of Glouoester's sistam, for a wilc. They wore

4th arch, by the Earl of Glouoester. Some of his

acts in that capacity are cited in a etition to Parlia-

his Parliament in London, and the ordainors gave in
their repom, four articles of which provided for the
banishment of Gaveston‚ to which the King was forced
